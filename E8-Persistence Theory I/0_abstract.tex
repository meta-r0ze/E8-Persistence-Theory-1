The Standard Model of particle physics relies on over 20 free parameters that must be determined by measurement rather than first principles. In this work, we posit that these constants are the necessary boundary conditions of a discrete $E_8$ lattice gauge theory projected onto a 4-dimensional manifold. By applying the \textbf{Persistence Principle}, the minimization of Entropic Action within a finite-capacity system, we identify five integer invariants $\mathbb{S} = \{ D=4, \Delta=43, \sigma=5, \nu=16, \chi=2 \}$ that define the geometric kernel of the vacuum.

From these integers, we derive the Fine-Structure Constant ($\alpha^{-1}$) as the calculated \textbf{Geometric Impedance} of the substrate. The derivation yields $\alpha^{-1}_{geo} \approx 137.035999212$, matching (close? tbd how to phrase...) We further demonstrate that the running of the coupling to the electroweak scale ($\alpha^{-1}(M_Z) \approx 128.9$) emerges naturally from the geometric screening of the lattice boundary. 

Finally, we show that the Strong Coupling ($\alpha_s$), Weak Mixing Angle ($\sin^2 \theta_W$), Gravitational parameters ($\alpha_G, M_P$), and the complete Higgs sector—including the VEV ($v$), scalar mass ($m_H$), self-coupling ($\lambda$), and electron Yukawa ($y_e$) are strictly derived harmonics of this impedance. This framework provides a \textbf{Geometric Initialization} for the Standard Model, replacing arbitrary parameter tuning with a self-consistent derivation hierarchy.
