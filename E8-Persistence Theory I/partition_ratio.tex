\section{The Partition Ratio: Weak Mixing Angle (\texorpdfstring{$\sin^2 \theta_W$}{sin2 theta_W})}

\textbf{The Standard Model Ansatz:} The Weak Mixing Angle is a free parameter defining the rotation between the $U(1)_Y$ and $SU(2)_L$ sectors. It determines the partition of the unified electroweak force into the electromagnetic and weak components.

Standard physics relies on the Weak Mixing Angle as an empirical input ($s^2_W \approx 0.223$) to satisfy the mass ratio $M_W/M_Z$. However, it offers no geometric origin for this specific magnitude, nor a mechanism to resolve the experimental tension between the value derived from direct mass measurements ($0.22291 \pm 0.00011$) \cite{PhysRevD.110.030001} and the value derived from global electroweak fits ($0.22354 \pm 0.00006$) \cite{PhysRevD.110.030001}.

\textbf{The $E_8$-Persistence Derivation:} In this framework, the Weak Mixing Angle is derived as the \textbf{Resonance Partition Fraction}. We demonstrate that the tension is not experimental error, but the geometric distinction between the \textbf{Discrete Hardware} (Lattice) and the \textbf{Continuous Geometry} (Projection).

\subsection{The Geometric Derivation}

We calculate the mixing angle as the ratio of the \textbf{Active Resonance Signal} to the \textbf{Total Geometric Infrastructure} required to support it.

\subsubsection{The Components}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Signal (Numerator):} The Heegner Resonance ($\Delta = 43$). This represents the fundamental frequency of the lattice. The Weak interaction, being the force of transmutation and decay, couples directly to this resonant heartbeat of the vacuum.
    
    \item \textbf{The Infrastructure (Denominator):} The Total Electroweak Capacity is the sum of the Manifold Projection, the Chiral Channels, and the Interaction Symmetry:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Manifold Projection ($D\Delta$):} The projection of the resonance onto the 4D spacetime manifold ($4 \times 43 = 172$).
        \item \textbf{Chiral Channels ($\nu$):} The available channel capacity for fermion information ($\nu = 16$).
        \item \textbf{Interaction Order ($\sigma$):} The symmetry overhead required for unification ($\sigma = 5$).
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{The Partition Formula}

The mixing angle is defined as the fraction of the lattice resonance relative to the total coordination budget:

\begin{equation}
\sin^2 \theta_W = \frac{\Delta}{D\Delta + \nu + \sigma}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Numerical Result}

Substituting the invariant values:

\begin{equation}
\sin^2 \theta_W = \frac{43}{4(43) + 16 + 5} = \frac{43}{193} \approx \mathbf{0.222798}
\end{equation}

This geometric value resolves the experimental tension by aligning strictly with the \textbf{Direct Mass Measurement} (the physical particle), distinguishable from the Global Fit (the geometry field) and the Running Coupling (dynamic loops):

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Geometric Prediction (Integer):} $0.22280$
    \item \textbf{Experimental (Direct Mass)}: $0.22291 \pm 0.00011$ \cite{PhysRevD.110.030001}
    \item \textbf{Experimental (Global Fit)}: $0.22354 \pm 0.00006$
    \item \textbf{Experimental ($\overline{MS}$ Running)}: $0.23122$

    \item \textbf{Experimental Value (On-Shell):} $\approx 0.223$ (Depends on renormalization scheme)
    \item \textbf{Precision:} Matches the on-shell definition to within \textbf{0.05\%}.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Recursive Validation: The Cost of Time}
The geometric validity of the Weak Mixing Angle is reinforced by a structural link back to the Vacuum Impedance derived in \cref{sec:Persistence_Condition}..

Recall the \textbf{Temporal Tax} ($T$), the metabolic cost of a state transition defined purely by lattice integers in Eq. \ref{eq:alpha_inverse}:
$$ T_{geo} \approx 1.185 \times 10^{-5} $$

We now observe that this tax corresponds to the second-order electromagnetic coupling ($\alpha^2$) modulated by the Weak Mixing Angle partition we just derived ($\sin^2 \theta_W = 43/193$).

\begin{equation}
T_{check} = \alpha^2 \sin^2 \theta_W
\end{equation}

Substituting the strictly derived values from this framework:
$$ T_{check} = \left(\frac{1}{137.035999160}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{43}{193}\right) $$
$$ T_{check} \approx (5.325 \times 10^{-5}) \cdot (0.2228) \approx \mathbf{1.186 \times 10^{-5}} $$

\textbf{Conclusion:} The match (within 0.1\%) confirms internal consistency. The "Time Tax" $T$ appearing in the Fine-Structure Constant is not a random correction; it is the specific geometric cost of authorizing a Weak Interaction. The Weak Force is the mechanism of Time (state transition), and $\alpha^2 \sin^2 \theta_W$ is the toll paid to the vacuum to execute it.

\textbf{Conclusion:} The integer derivation ($43/193$) correctly identifies the On-Shell angle derived from the physical W-boson mass (hitting the lower bound of the $1\sigma$ range), distinguishing it from the continuous field geometry ($1/2\sqrt{5} \approx 0.2236$) detected in global fits.

\subsection{Physical Interpretation}
The derivation matches the \textbf{On-Shell definition} ($s^2_W \equiv 1 - M_W^2/M_Z^2$) to within 0.05\%. This identification is structurally required: because the $W$ and $Z$ bosons are fundamental lattice resonances, their mass ratio is fixed by the static integer invariants ($\Delta, \sigma$). The higher values observed in effective schemes (like $\overline{MS} \approx 0.231$) include dynamic vacuum polarization loops ("running"). The lattice invariants define the \textbf{Bare Geometric Ratio} at the pole mass, which corresponds physically to the On-Shell scheme.
