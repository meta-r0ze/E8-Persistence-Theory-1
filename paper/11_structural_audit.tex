The ultimate test of the $E_8$-Persistence Theory is replacing the free parameters of the Standard Model global fit. Unlike Effective Field Theories (EFTs) which allow parameters to float to fit data, this framework creates a rigid dependency graph where the inputs are integers.

Consequently, the theory generates specific "Hard Constraints" that serve as falsification criteria. We propose the following analyses for groups with access to electroweak fit packages (e.g., Gfitter, HEPfit).

\subsection{The Zero-Degree-of-Freedom Electroweak Fit}

Standard global fits treat the Fine-Structure Constant ($\alpha$), the Fermi Constant ($G_F$), and the Weak Mixing Angle ($\sin^2\theta_W$) as floating nuisance parameters constrained only by measurement errors. 

\textbf{The Audit Task:} Run the global electroweak fit with these parameters fixed to their geometric derivations:
\begin{align}
\alpha^{-1} &= \AlphaInvVal \dots \quad (\text{Fixed}) \\
\sin^2 \theta_W &= 43/193 \quad (\text{Fixed}) \\
G_F &= (\sqrt{2}v^2)^{-1} \quad (\text{Fixed via } v_{geo})
\end{align}

\textbf{Falsification Criterion:} If the global $\chi^2$ of the fit degrades by $\Delta\chi^2 > 9$ ($3\sigma$) compared to the standard floating fit, the geometric invariant hypothesis is falsified. If the $\chi^2$ remains stable, the free parameters are proven redundant.

\subsection{Geometric Prohibitions (No-Go Theorems)}

The integer invariants $\{\nu=16, D=4\}$ act as hard hardware limits, not merely soft thermodynamic costs. Unlike effective field theories where new heavy particles can be assumed to exist at higher energy scales (just "out of reach"), this framework asserts that the \textbf{geometry required to host such particles does not exist}.

Therefore, the following are not merely predictions of instability, but of \textbf{Structural Non-Existence}. Any detection of these signals would imply the lattice geometry is incorrect, falsifying the theory.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Kaluza-Klein Prohibition ($D=4$):} Standard String Theories require extra spatial dimensions ($D=10, 11$). The $E_8$ projection mandates $D=4$ to preserve lattice self-duality. 
    \textit{Test:} A confirmed detection of Kaluza-Klein graviton modes or large extra dimensions at the LHC/FCC falsifies the projection mechanism.
    
    \item \textbf{The Supersymmetry Prohibition ($\nu=16$):} 
    The chiral truncation limits the active channel capacity to 16 states per generation. The Standard Model fermions already occupy exactly 48 states ($3 \times 16$). The lattice is saturated. 
    \textit{Clarification:} This is not a mass limit. Even if "sparticles" were massless, they could not exist because there are no available bit-addresses in the node to encode their quantum numbers.
    \textit{Test:} The discovery of any supersymmetric partner falsifies the Chiral Rank invariant.

    \item \textbf{The GUT Prohibition ($\sigma \neq \chi$):} In this framework, the forces arise from distinct geometric features (Interaction $\sigma$ vs. Boundary $\chi$). Consequently, the framework predicts that precision measurements will continue to show the gauge couplings failing to unify at any single energy scale.
    \textit{Test:} The persistence of the "GUT mismatch" in high-energy data, often treated as evidence for missing threshold corrections, is here identified as a confirmed geometric feature of the substrate.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Precision \texorpdfstring{$\alpha$}{alpha} Vector}
The most immediate test is the convergence of the Fine-Structure Constant. The geometric value ($\alpha^{-1}_{geo} = \AlphaInvVal$) lies between the current electron $g-2$ average and the Cesium recoil measurements.

\textbf{Prediction:} As experimental precision improves via next-generation atom interferometry, the world average must converge to the geometric value. A definitive shift to $\alpha^{-1} \approx 137.03600...$ or $\alpha^{-1} \approx 137.035998...$ ($>5\sigma$ deviation) would falsify the topological assembly of the vacuum impedance.

\subsection{Theoretical Audits (Community Verification)}

The framework makes specific structural claims that allow for rigorous theoretical auditing. We identify open derivations that serve as definitive tests :

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Lattice Loop Calculation:} We identified the QCD beta function coefficients ($11, 2/3$) with geometric invariants of the substrate. An \textit{ab initio} lattice field theory calculation should confirm that these values arise as eigenvalues of the transfer matrix without manual identification.
    
    \item \textbf{The Stiffness Check:} We derived gravity as a Goldstone mode of the capacity constraint. A non-perturbative Monte Carlo simulation of the lattice should recover the massless spin-2 propagator and verify the stiffness coefficient $\kappa \to 1$.
\end{enumerate}
