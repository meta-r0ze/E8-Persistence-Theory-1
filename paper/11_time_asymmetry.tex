\textbf{The Standard Model Ansatz:} The Jarlskog Invariant ($J \approx 3 \times 10^{-5}$) quantifies the strength of CP violation, the fundamental asymmetry between matter and antimatter. In the Standard Model, it is a parameter of the CKM matrix determined by experiment. The theory offers no reason why this value is non-zero yet so small, nor why it is required for the universe to exist.

\textbf{The E8-Persistence Derivation:} We identify $J$ not as an arbitrary mixing parameter, but as the \textbf{Geometric Frustration} of the vacuum. It is the irreducible entropic cost of mapping the 5-fold internal symmetry of the lattice ($\sigma=5$) onto the 4-dimensional spacetime manifold ($D=4$). This geometric mismatch creates the directional bias required for the Arrow of Time.


\subsection{The System Specification}
Time asymmetry arises from the interaction between the intrinsic cost of state updates and the geometry of the projection.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Temporal Cost ($T_{geo}$):} As derived in System II (Eq. \ref{eq:alpha_inverse}), the entropic cost of a single state transition is determined by the Total Lattice Capacity ($N=\nu * 2=32$).
    $$ T_{geo} = \frac{1}{N^3} \cdot \frac{\chi}{\sigma} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{\sigma}{D\Delta}\right) \approx 1.185 \times 10^{-5} $$
    \textit{Note:} The cubic dependence ($1/N^3$) reflects the 3-body decay phase space of Weak Interactions, where the initial state and two final states each require an $N$-fold aperture allocation.
    
    \item \textbf{The Projection Frustration ($\phi^2$):} The $E_8$ lattice contains the non-crystallographic $H_4$ Coxeter group (the 600-cell) as a maximal subgroup. This group is characterized by 5-fold icosahedral symmetry, which cannot tile 4D Euclidean space without introducing topological defects. The area deficit (frustration) of projecting 5-fold geometry onto a 4-fold manifold scales with the Golden Ratio $\phi = (1+\sqrt{5})/2$ as $\phi^2 \approx 2.618$.
    
    \item \textbf{Manifold  Quantization Efficiency ($\eta$):} Since this frustration signal propagates through the bulk lattice (depth $\Delta/2$) before manifesting at the 4D boundary, it incurs the efficiency factor $\eta = 1 - 1/(D\Delta) \approx 0.994$, derived in System II.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Derivation: The Frustration Formula}
The Jarlskog Invariant is the Temporal Cost ($T_{geo}$) amplified by the Projection Frustration. The frustration acts as a geometric multiplier: every temporal state transition occurs within the constrained 4D projection, and the $\phi^2$-scaled area deficit accumulates as an additional entropic cost.

\begin{equation}
J_{geo} = (\phi^2 \cdot \eta) \cdot T_{geo}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Numerical Calculation:}
Substituting the derived values:
\begin{equation}
J_{geo} = (2.61803 \cdot 0.994186) \cdot (1.1852 \times 10^{-5})
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
J_{geo} \approx 2.6028 \times (1.1852 \times 10^{-5}) \approx \mathbf{\JarlskogVal}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Physical Interpretation: The Golden Shadow}
CP violation is not a random accident. Just as a pentagonal prism casts a shadow with 5-fold symmetry onto a flat surface (losing perfect symmetry), the $E_8$ lattice casts a ``Golden Shadow" onto 4D spacetime. This shadow is the Jarlskog Invariant—the geometric signature of Time's directional flow.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Why CP violation is weak:} The frustration ($\phi^2 \approx 2.6$) amplifies the Temporal Cost, but the base cost ($T_{geo} \approx 10^{-5}$) is inherently small due to the efficiency of the weak aperture.
    
    \item \textbf{Why matter dominates:} Without CP violation ($J=0$), the universe would be symmetric and annihilate. The non-zero $J$ creates a topological bias favoring matter, which is amplified by cosmological expansion.
    
    \item \textbf{The Baryogenesis Gap:} While $J_{geo}$ matches the Quark Sector mixing ($J_{CKM}$), this magnitude is insufficient to explain the total observed baryon asymmetry ($\eta \sim 10^{-9}$) through CKM physics alone. This necessitates significant additional CP violation in the Lepton Sector (PMNS matrix), which is derived in Paper III via the neutrino lattice mechanism.
\end{itemize}
