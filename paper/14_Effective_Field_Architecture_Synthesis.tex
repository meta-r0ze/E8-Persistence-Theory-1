\section{Synthesis: Architecture Closure} \label{sec:Synthesis}
We have derived the fundamental constants as geometric outputs. However, for this architecture to be valid, it must satisfy Global Impedance Matching: the internal impedances of the regulators must exactly match the geometric apertures of the partitions to prevent information reflection (dissipation).

We conclude by explicitly demonstrating that the derived parameters form a closed, self-consistent system at three distinct levels.

\subsection{Closure 1: Bandwidth Conservation (The Chiral Limit)}
The total allocated capacity must exactly match the hardware limit ($\nu = 16$) without overflow. By summing the derived loads for the Bulk (Gravity), the Boundary (Topology), and the Gauge (Interaction), we verify the conservation of information:

\begin{equation}
\underbrace{B_{res}}_{\text{Gravity}} + \underbrace{\frac{\chi}{\sigma-\chi}}_{\text{Boundary Storage}} + \underbrace{\alpha}_{\text{Gauge}} \stackrel{?}{=} \nu
\end{equation}

Substituting the derived geometric values:
\begin{equation}
15.326... + 0.666... + 0.0073... = 15.9993 \approx 16 \quad (\text{Error} < 0.005\%)
\end{equation}

This precise summation confirms that Gravity is not an external force added to the theory, but the \textbf{inevitable consequence} of using the remaining bandwidth. In a $\nu=16$ universe, the gravitational coupling $\alpha_G$ is strictly determined by the residual bits left after determining the gauge and boundary sectors.

\subsection{Closure 2: Surface Impedance Match (Higgs Subsystem)}
The Surface Regulator (Higgs) must structurally match the aperture of the force it mediates (The Weak Interaction, $\sigma + 1 = 6$). Using the derived Higgs Impedance $Z_H$:

\begin{equation}
Z_H = \frac{1}{\lambda} e^{-2\lambda} \approx 5.97 \approx (\sigma + 1) \quad (\text{Error } < 0.6\%)
\end{equation}

This confirms the local architecture minimizes entropic drag by perfectly matching the vacuum resonance to the weak channel capacity.

\subsection{Closure 3: Core Impedance Match (Gravity Subsystem)}
The Bulk Regulator (Gravity) is defined as the system that saturates the lattice at the core scale. We verify that the derived Planck Mass ($M_P$) and Attenuation Factor ($\alpha^{\Delta/2}$) satisfy the Unity Coupling Condition:

\begin{equation}
Z_G(M_P) = \sqrt{\frac{B_{res}}{\alpha^{\Delta/2}}} \cdot \frac{m_e}{M_P} \equiv 1
\end{equation}
This confirms that $M_P$ is correctly identified as the geometric saturation point of the lattice. The Hierarchy Problem ($10^{40}$) is resolved as the precise ratio required to normalize the bulk impedance to unity.

\subsection{Final Verdict: Global Solvency}
The Effective Field Architecture is globally solvent. The dimensionless ratios (Tier 1) and energy scales (Tier 2) are not independent parameters; they are the unique solutions to the global impedance matching problem. The system persists because it transfers information from the lattice core ($r = \Delta/2$) to the surface ($r = 0$) with minimal dissipative loss, providing the stable stage for the formation of matter.
