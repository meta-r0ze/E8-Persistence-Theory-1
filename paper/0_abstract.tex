We utilize the Standard Model of particle physics as a rigorous verification testbed for Informational Energetics. By treating the vacuum as a finite-capacity system governed by a Persistence Principle (the minimization of Entropic Action), we identify the unique projection of an $E_8$ lattice onto a 4-dimensional manifold. This yields five geometric invariants $\mathbb{S} = \{D{=}4, \Delta{=}43, \nu{=}16, \sigma{=}5, \chi{=}2\}$ which uniquely determine the Standard Model gauge group ($SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$) and generation number ($n_{\text{gen}} = 3$).

We demonstrate that the Standard Model Lagrangian is not a fundamental axiom, but the emergent Entropic Action of this substrate, recovering the Einstein-Hilbert, Yang-Mills, and Dirac terms without modification.

The Fine-Structure Constant emerges as the Geometric Impedance of this substrate. Our derivation yields zero-momentum baseline $\alpha^{-1}_{\text{geo}} = \AlphaInvVal \dots$, within $0.6\sigma$ of the CODATA 2022 value (running coupling evolution is derived in Section VI.E). We further derive the Strong Coupling ($\alpha_s = \AlphaSVal \dots$), Weak Mixing Angle ($\sin^2\theta_W = \WeakAngleVal \dots$), gravitational hierarchy ($M_P/m_e = \alpha^{-\Delta/4}$), and complete Higgs sector ($v$, $m_H$, $\lambda$, $y_e$) as geometric consequences of the same five integers across three hierarchical systems.

This framework does not replace the standard model, but replaces parameter fitting with geometric derivation, providing falsifiable predictions including the prohibition of Kaluza-Klein graviton modes and a fourth fermion generation.
