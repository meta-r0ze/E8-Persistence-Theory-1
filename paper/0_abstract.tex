We propose that the fundamental constants of the Standard Model are not arbitrary inputs, but the necessary boundary conditions of a discrete $E_8$ lattice projected onto a 4-dimensional manifold. By treating the vacuum as a finite-capacity system governed by a Persistence Principle (the minimization of Entropic Action), we derive five geometric invariants $\mathbb{S} = \{D{=}4, \Delta{=}43, \nu{=}16, \sigma{=}5, \chi{=}2\}$ and prove they uniquely determine the Standard Model gauge group ($SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$) and generation number ($n_{\text{gen}} = 3$).

The Fine-Structure Constant emerges as the Geometric Impedance of this substrate. Our derivation yields zero-momentum baseline $\alpha^{-1}_{\text{geo}} = \ExecuteMetaData[src/results.tex]{AlphaInvVal} \dots$, within $0.6\sigma$ of the CODATA 2022 value (running coupling evolution is derived in Section VI.E). We further derive the Strong Coupling ($\alpha_s = \ExecuteMetaData[src/results.tex]{AlphaSVal} \dots$), Weak Mixing Angle ($\sin^2\theta_W = \ExecuteMetaData[src/results.tex]{WeakAngleVal} \dots$), gravitational hierarchy ($M_P/m_e = \alpha^{-\Delta/4}$), and complete Higgs sector ($v$, $m_H$, $\lambda$, $y_e$) as geometric consequences of the same five integers across three hierarchical systems.

This framework does not replace the standard model, but replaces parameter fitting with geometric derivation, providing falsifiable predictions including the prohibition of Kaluza-Klein graviton modes and a fourth fermion generation.
