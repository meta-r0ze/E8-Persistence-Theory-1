We present a \textbf{Geometric Initialization} of the Standard Model, deriving its fundamental constants as the necessary boundary conditions of a finite-capacity information-processing substrate. By treating the vacuum as a discrete $E_8$ lattice governed by the minimization of Entropic Action, we identify the unique thermodynamic ground state (Gibbs State) satisfying unitarity, causality, and topological stability.

The singular solution set capable of resolving the structural arbitrariness of the vacuum is $\mathbb{S} = \{D{=}4, \Delta{=}43, \nu{=}16, \sigma{=}5, \chi{=}2\}$, which resolve the structural arbitrariness of the Standard Model. The gauge group ($SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$) emerges from the topological decomposition ($\sigma=5, \chi=2$), the generation count is fixed by the symmetry remainder ($n_{\text{gen}} = \sigma - \chi = 3$), and the chiral capacity ($\nu=16$) structurally prohibits extensions like supersymmetry or a fourth generation.

The Standard Model Lagrangian emerges as the Entropic Action of this lattice, while General Relativity appears as the Goldstone mode of broken translational symmetry in the presence of matter, not a separate force, but the geometric response of the substrate to energy density.

We derive the fundamental constants via global impedance matching with \textbf{zero free parameters}:

\textbf{Tier 1 (Dimensionless Control):} Fine-Structure Constant ($\alpha^{-1} = \AlphaInvVal$, within 0.6$\sigma$ of CODATA); Strong Coupling ($\alpha_s = \AlphaSVal$); Weak Mixing Angle ($\sin^2\theta_W = \WeakAngleVal$, 0.09\% precision); Cabibbo Angle ($\theta_C = \CabibboAngleVal$); Jarlskog Invariant ($J = \JarlskogVal$).

\textbf{Tier 2 (Mass Scales):} Higgs VEV ($v = \HiggsVEVVal$); Fermi Constant ($G_F = \FermiConstVal$); W-Boson Mass ($M_W = \WBosonMassVal$, resolving the CDF II tension); Higgs Mass ($m_H = \HiggsMassVal$).

\textbf{Tier 3 (Hierarchies):} The Planck/Electron mass ratio ($M_P/m_e \propto \alpha^{-\Delta/4}$), resolving the hierarchy problem as geometric attenuation across lattice depth rather than fine-tuning.

Numerical validation confirms the theory's dynamic consistency via three independent audits: 
(1) A Monte Carlo diffusion audit derives the Fine-Structure Constant from lattice topology with $0.0007\%$ precision, verifying the geometric impedance mechanism; and 
(2) A lattice simulation of the emergent gravity mechanism recovers the Einstein-Hilbert action with \textbf{Vacuum Stiffness $\kappa = 1.000000$}, the Newtonian potential ($1/r^2$ scaling) to within $0.15\%$; and effective light speed $c_{eff}=1.000000$, confirming Lorentz invariance on the discrete grid;
(3) a zero-degree-of-freedom global fit of five fundamental observables ($\alpha^{-1}$, $G_F$, $m_W$, $\alpha_s$, $m_H$) yields a total $\chi^2 = \bosonictotalchiVal$ (Reduced $\chi^2 = \bosonicreducedchiVal$), confirming the geometric derivation captures physical correlations to high precision.

This framework replaces parameter fitting with geometric derivation, providing falsifiable predictions for the fermion spectrum. This is Paper I of a series deriving the fermion spectrum (II), flavor mixing (III), cosmology (IV), and quantum foundations (V).
